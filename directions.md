Add more HepMC3 functionality like:
    Particle creation and manipulation
    Vertex handling
    Event construction

Now that we have the basic functionality working (FourVectors, Particles, Vertices, and Events), we can move on to implementing more advanced features.
1. Add Cross-section calculations:
   - Implement GenCrossSection functionality
   - Add methods for setting and getting cross-section values
   - Add uncertainty handling

2. Add PDF Information:
   - Implement GenPdfInfo functionality
   - Add methods for parton information
   - Handle PDF sets and scales

3. Add Heavy Ion functionality:
   - Implement GenHeavyIon
   - Add methods for heavy ion specific properties
   - Handle collision parameters

4. Add Event manipulation methods:
   - Event traversal (getting all particles, vertices)
   - Finding particles by PDG ID
   - Event statistics

Which feature would you like to implement next? We can continue with the same pattern of:
1. Adding C++ wrapper functions
2. Implementing Julia interface
3. Writing comprehensive tests
